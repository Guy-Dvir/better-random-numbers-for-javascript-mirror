The status of `Xorshift03`, `KISS07` and `LFIB4` is somewhat unclear. The sources are Usenet posts, and one of them explicitly states ["You
are welcome to use one or both of the above"](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.fortran/msg/6edb8ad6ec5421a5). It seems unlikely that Professor Marsaglia intended to restrict their use in any way, but on the other hand, I have no indication that he ever formally released them to the public domain.
